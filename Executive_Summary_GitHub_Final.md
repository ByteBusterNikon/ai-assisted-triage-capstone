## 📄 Quick Intro (for GitHub README placement)
A sophisticated four-stage compromise impacted **win2.mcp.lab** on **2025-10-30** (17:30–18:26 UTC).  
The attacker disabled Windows Defender, deployed a fileless .NET payload, and established persistent remote access using AnyDesk.  
This public release is **fully educational** and demonstrates how to write structured triage reports with AI-assisted tooling.

## ⚡ TL;DR
- Simulated compromise of **win2.mcp.lab** (2025-10-30, 17:30–18:26 UTC).  
- Four-stage malware chain: Defender bypass → recon → payload → backdoor.  
- Persistent remote access via **AnyDesk**.  
- Demonstrates triage workflow, IOC collection, and AI-assisted reporting.  
- Confidence: **99% (Confirmed Compromise)**

## 🔍 Summary of Findings (obfuscated format for public view)
- **Defense Evasion:** `anz.ps1` — disabled Defender & UAC (simulated).  
- **Reconnaissance:** `kor.bat` — enumerated users, groups, network info.  
- **Payload:** `tyvm87.dat` — XOR-encrypted .NET loader (key `0xAA`).  
- **Backdoor:** `AnyDesk.exe` — persistent service & startup shortcut (C2 simulation).  

**Example Obfuscated IOCs**
```
AnyDesk relay: 64[.]31[.]23[.]26
Internal host: 10[.]1[.]145[.]123
Evidence URL: hxxp://medic[.]mcp[.]lab:8000/collections/1761872376_tyvm87[.]dat

## 🧾 Indicators Table (educational format)
| Identifier (obfuscated) | Analyst Comment |
|-------------------------|-----------------|
| `...\\anz.ps1` | Defender-disabling PowerShell script (simulated) |
| `...\\kor.bat` | Recon script enumerating host & network |
| `tyvm87.dat` | XOR-encrypted .NET loader (demonstration payload) |
| `64[.]31[.]23[.]26` | Simulated AnyDesk relay |
| `SHA256: D2A7B55F...778A1` | Example truncated hash |

## 🛡️ Handling & Best Practices
- Do **not** include or share real binaries, credentials, or live C2 indicators.  
- Use obfuscation (`[.]`, `hxxp`, truncated hashes) when publishing security write-ups publicly.  
- Add an educational or research disclaimer to distinguish real vs. simulated data.  
- Reference your internal/private report if using this template in a real-world scenario.
