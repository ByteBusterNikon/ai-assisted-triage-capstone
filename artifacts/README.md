# 💾 Artifacts – AI-Assisted Triage Capstone

This directory contains simulated **forensic artifacts**, indicators of compromise (IOCs), and supporting data captured during the triage process.

## 📘 Contents
- **Sample Logs:** Extracted system, event, and PowerShell logs.
- **Network Traces:** Simulated C2 communication and outbound traffic samples.
- **Malware Artifacts:** Obfuscated scripts, encrypted payloads, and evidence files (educational only).
- **Hashes & Signatures:** Recorded SHA256 hashes for validation and cross-reference.

## ⚙️ Usage
These samples are designed to demonstrate how an analyst would identify, collect, and document malicious activity in a controlled lab environment.

> 🧠 **Note:** All files within this directory are *synthetic* and created strictly for educational purposes. No real malware, live payloads, or production data are included.
