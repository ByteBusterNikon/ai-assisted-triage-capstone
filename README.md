## 🎯 Repository Overview
This repository demonstrates a **simulated digital forensics and incident response (DFIR)** workflow powered by **AI-assisted triage and reporting**.  
The project centers on a fictional Windows host, **win2.mcp.lab**, which experiences a multi-stage malware compromise.  
It showcases how **LLMs and automated analysis tools** can enhance detection, investigation, and executive reporting during an incident.

Both public and full versions of the executive summary are provided, formatted for GitHub, Discord, and PDF export.

## 🧩 About the Capstone
This capstone combines host triage techniques with **AI-assisted analysis and reporting** using a simulated compromise scenario.  
The objective is to test the analyst’s ability to:
- Identify persistence mechanisms  
- Detect malicious process activity  
- Recognize indicators of network-based compromise  
- Summarize findings into an executive report  
- Apply **prompt-engineering techniques** to enhance AI-assisted investigation  

**Bonus:** Identify additional artifacts, obfuscation methods, and indicators using structured reasoning and automated summarization.

## 🤖 How This Simulates AI-Assisted IR Workflows
This project demonstrates how modern LLMs and DFIR tools like *Medic MCP* can:
1. Parse triage data and surface relevant anomalies.  
2. Automate executive summary generation in Markdown/PDF formats.  
3. Suggest containment and remediation steps using context-aware reasoning.  
4. Provide stakeholder-ready communication templates that are concise and professional.  

Through this workflow, analysts learn to integrate **human judgment with AI augmentation** — improving efficiency, consistency, and communication across the incident response lifecycle.
